# XMPL NG
Welcome to the XMPie XMPL NG.

This is the central resource for information about XMPL, XMPie's language for personalizing URLs. Using this library you can easily build personalized webpages (PURLs) that are based on XMPie campaigns, with HTML tags.

The technology is built on javascript code, making it very easy to integrate into your existing website. It is also possible to integrate XMPL with your Angular and React application, and provide advanced functionality.

The XMPie XMPL server is the server that connects your XMPie campaign with your webpages. The server defines a collection of REST services with which the XMPL library communicates, and makes available for the webpages in form of HTML tags and javascript.
